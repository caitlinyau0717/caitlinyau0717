## Hi!

Currently, I am a Web Design/Developer intern at SheBytes, a new startup with a mission to empower women in tech. I am also a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Information Technology and Web Sciences. Additionally, I have a certification in the Foundations of Machine Learning granted by Cornell University. I was previously a Break Through Tech AI Fellow at Cornell Tech. 

I previously worked with Break Through Tech AI in collaboration with Google on a Machine Learning project to analyze Google search trends and understand how interest in these topics varies across time and location. I utilized Google Trends and Google Colab to collect and analyze search term data, and then make time series predictions using various machine learning models, including Random Forest and SARIMA.
